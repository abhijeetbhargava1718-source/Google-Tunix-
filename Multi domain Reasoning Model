# Multi-Domain Reasoning Model: Training Strategy

## 🎯 The Challenge

The competition evaluates models across **6 diverse domains**, requiring a single model that can:
- Solve mathematical problems with clear reasoning
- Generate creative writing (stories, poems, narratives)
- Write and debug code
- Summarize complex text
- Brainstorm innovative ideas
- Explain scientific concepts

This is significantly harder than training a domain-specific model!

## 📊 Data Collection Strategy

### Domain 1: Mathematics (40% of dataset)

**Why the largest?** Math is objective and has clear right/wrong answers, making it the evaluation anchor.

**Sources:**
1. **GSM8K** (Primary): 7,500 grade school word problems
   ```python
   from datasets import load_dataset
   gsm8k = load_dataset("gsm8k", "main")
   ```

2. **MATH Dataset**: Competition-level problems
   ```python
   math_dataset = load_dataset("hendrycks/math")
   ```

3. **MetaMathQA**: Large-scale synthetic dataset (optional for expansion)

**Formatting Strategy:**
- Extract existing step-by-step solutions from GSM8K
- Parse answer format: "Solution #### Answer"
- Reformat into <reasoning> and <answer> structure

### Domain 2: Creative Writing (15% of dataset)

**Challenge:** Defining "reasoning" for creative tasks

**Approach:** Teach the model to think about:
- Story structure (setup, conflict, resolution)
- Poetic devices (metaphor, rhythm, imagery)
- Character development
- Thematic elements

**Sources:**
1. **WritingPrompts** (Reddit): Creative prompts with responses
   ```python
   writing = load_dataset("euclaise/writingprompts")
   ```

2. **Custom Examples**: Create 50-100 high-quality examples showing creative process:
   - Short stories with structural reasoning
   - Poems with device/meter reasoning
   - Character sketches with development reasoning

**Sample Reasoning for Creative Task:**
```
Prompt: Write a metaphor for loneliness

Reasoning:
Step 1: Identify emotion characteristics - Isolation, emptiness, silence
Step 2: Find physical correlate - Empty spaces, vast distances
Step 3: Add sensory details - Cold, echo, darkness
Step 4: Craft unexpected comparison - Avoid clichés
Step 5: Polish for impact

Answer: Loneliness is an empty stadium after the final whistle,
where your voice echoes back but no one applauds.
```

### Domain 3: Coding (15% of dataset)

**What to teach:** Algorithm design, debugging logic, code optimization

**Sources:**
1. **MBPP** (Mostly Basic Python Problems): 1,000 entry-level Python tasks
   ```python
   mbpp = load_dataset("mbpp")
   ```

2. **HumanEval**: 164 programming problems
   ```python
   humaneval = load_dataset("openai_humaneval")
   ```

3. **CodeContests**: Competition programming (harder, use selectively)

**Reasoning Structure:**
1. Problem understanding
2. Algorithm selection
3. Edge case identification
4. Implementation strategy
5. Complexity analysis (optional)

**Example:**
```python
Problem: Remove duplicates from a list while preserving order

Reasoning:
Step 1: Understand requirement - Keep first occurrence, remove rest
Step 2: Consider approaches - Set loses order, dict preserves it
Step 3: Choose solution - Use dict.fromkeys() or manual tracking
Step 4: Handle edge cases - Empty list, all unique, all duplicates
Step 5: Implement efficiently - O(n) time complexity

Answer:
def remove_duplicates(lst):
    return list(dict.fromkeys(lst))
```

### Domain 4: Summarization (10% of dataset)

**Skills to teach:** Information extraction, prioritization, conciseness

**Sources:**
1. **CNN/DailyMail**: News article summarization
   ```python
   cnn_dm = load_dataset("cnn_dailymail", "3.0.0")
   ```

2. **XSum**: Extreme summarization (one-sentence summaries)
   ```python
   xsum = load_dataset("xsum")
   ```

**Reasoning Structure:**
1. Identify main topic/thesis
2. Extract key supporting points
3. Remove redundant information
4. Note important entities/numbers
5. Synthesize concisely

### Domain 5: Creative Ideation (10% of dataset)

**Challenge:** Most abstract domain - brainstorming and innovation

**Approach:** Create custom examples (no perfect dataset exists)

**Categories to cover:**
- Product ideas
- Problem-solving approaches
- Business concepts
- Social innovations
- Process improvements

**Reasoning Pattern:**
1. Understand problem/need
2. Identify constraints
3. Brainstorm without filtering
4. Evaluate feasibility
5. Select best ideas with justification

**Example Template:**
```
Question: How can we reduce food waste in restaurants?

Reasoning:
Step 1: Identify waste sources - Over-ordering, portion sizes, spoilage
Step 2: Consider stakeholders - Restaurants, customers, suppliers
Step 3: Explore technology solutions - Apps, AI prediction, smart storage
Step 4: Evaluate social approaches - Donation programs, customer education
Step 5: Prioritize by impact and feasibility

Answer:
1. Smart Inventory System: AI predicts demand based on historical data,
   weather, events to optimize ordering
2. Flexible Portion Sizing: Let customers choose small/regular/large with
   pricing incentives for smaller portions
3. Food Rescue Partnership: Real-time app connects restaurants with
   surplus food to local charities before closing time
```

### Domain 6: Basic Science (10% of dataset)

**Focus:** Clear explanations of scientific concepts, not advanced research

**Sources:**
1. **SciQ**: Multiple choice science questions (adapt to open-ended)
   ```python
   sciq = load_dataset("sciq")
   ```

2. **ARC**: AI2 Reasoning Challenge
   ```python
   arc = load_dataset("ai2_arc")
   ```

3. **Custom explanations**: Create 100-150 "Explain like I'm 12" examples

**Topics to cover:**
- Physics basics (gravity, energy, light, motion)
- Chemistry fundamentals (reactions, states of matter, atoms)
- Biology essentials (cells, evolution, ecosystems, human body)
- Earth science (weather, geology, climate)

**Reasoning Structure:**
1. Identify relevant scientific principle
2. Break down to fundamental concepts
3. Use analogies/examples
4. Connect to observable phenomena
5. Address common misconceptions
